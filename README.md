# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
The project is about creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
You can enter your US zip code and your feelings and the app will show you the current temperature in your area. 
The temperature and entered user data is stored in a local server. Then it is fetched and displayed in the UI.

## Instructions
1. Enter your OpenWeatherMap API key in `website/app.js` file, if you have one.
2. Start server by running `node server.js` in the terminal.
3. Open the browser and go to `localhost:8000`.
4. Enter your US zip code and your feelings.
5. Click on the button `Generate`.
